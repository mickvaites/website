<p>After nearly 30 years thinking about this, and then after a concerted effort about 20 years ago; I finally took the plunge and undertook the Foundation License. Now I&#8217;m working towards my Intermediate, so fingers crossed.</p>
<p>With the training and exams now being readily available online, it was a real no brainer. So a massive thanks toÂ <a href="https://www.essexham.co.uk">EssexHam</a> for their <a href="https://www.essexham.co.uk/train/foundation-online/">online training course</a>. They offer an a course over a number of weeks, or if you&#8217;re impatient (as I was) you can do a crash course.</p>
<p>The exam is also interesting, as the RSGB provide online invigilated exams. You setup a conference call with the invigilator, then load up and log-in to the exam software. It was quite surreal; I was pondering whether there was a typo in a question and the invigilator piped up and confirm my suspicions. Other than passing the exam; it was decidedly uneventful.</p>
<p>See yo on the air, 73</p>
