<p>After swatting hard, I passed my Intermediate earlier this month. A big shout out to Francis M0UKF, Lance 2E0YLD and the rest of the guys at <a href="https://www.oarc.uk">https://www.oarc.uk</a> (Online Amateur Radio Community M0OUK). These guys run a cracking Intermediate course. Just be prepared to put the time in, and you will prevail. </p>
<p>I have now enrolled for the Full course with them, fingers crossed.</p>
