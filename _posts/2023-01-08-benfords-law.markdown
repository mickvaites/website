Very similar to Zipf, which focused on the relationship of letters and words. Benford's Law looks at the frequency of numbers starting with a particular number.

This is an example of inline \\(\LaTeX\\). The following is Stokes' theorem in a
`displaymath` environment: \$$\int_{\partial \Omega} \omega = \int_{\Omega} d\omega\$$
