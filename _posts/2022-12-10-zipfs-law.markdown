Zipf's Law, named after George Zipf, states that the frequency of any word is inversley proportional to its rank.

$$P_{n}\sim \frac{1}{n^{a}}$$

Zipf's law was demonstrated using the <a h ref="http://korpus.uib.no/icame/manuals/BROWN/INDEX.HTM">Brown Corpus</a>, a collection of 500 text samples across various topics. Where it can be shown that the word 'the' accounts for approximately 7%, and the words 'of' and 'to' occur in approximate 3%.
