Entropy: Gods dice game
Oded and Hava Kafri

From the laws of thermodynamics we consider that energy cannot be added or removed from a system, it can only change in state; whereas in the second law states that things can only become more complex. 

and introduces physical entropy; 

From Carnots Efficiency, evolving through Clausius, Boltzmann and Gibbs Entropy

$$P_{D}=\frac{\int_{D}^{D+1}P(x)dx}{\int_{1}^{10}P(x)dx}=log_{10}\left ( 1+\frac{1}{D} \right )$$
